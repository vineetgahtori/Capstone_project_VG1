ML based project on price elasticity
Pricing a product is a crucial aspect in any business. Alot of thought process is out into it. There are different strategies to price different kinds of products. There are products whose sales are quite sensitive to their prices and as such a small change in their price can lead to noticeable change in their sales.

"This project work aims on the prediction for the best price of the items based on available quantities to have maximum profit".

In this project price elasticity term is used to define relationship inbetween price and quantities.

Price elasticity of demand or elasticity, is the degree to which the effective desire for something changes as its price changes. In general, people desire things less as those things become more expensive. However, for some products, the customer's desire could drop sharply even with a little price increase, and for other products, it could stay almost the same even with a big price increase. Economists use the term elasticity to denote this sensitivity to price increases. More precisely, price elasticity gives the percentage change in quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, holding everything else constant.
